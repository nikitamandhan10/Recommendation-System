Recommendation System

This repository demonstrates the development of a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset to build a model that predicts user preferences for movies.

📚 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a recommendation system that can suggest movies to users based on their past ratings. By leveraging collaborative filtering methods, the system identifies patterns in user behavior and makes personalized recommendations.

Key Features:

Collaborative Filtering: Employs user-item interactions to predict user preferences.

MovieLens Dataset: Utilizes the MovieLens dataset for training and evaluation.

Jupyter Notebooks: Provides a step-by-step guide through the development process.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn
